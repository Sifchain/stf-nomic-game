# Server Architecture

## Overview

The `stf-nomic-game` project is a FastAPI-based web application designed to facilitate online Nomic gamesâ€”a game where the rules evolve as players make decisions. This document outlines the architectural components of the server, including the API services, database models, WebSocket communication, and security features.

## Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM for database interactions.
- **Alembic**: Database migrations tool that utilizes SQLAlchemy.
- **Poetry**: Dependency management and packaging tool.
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

```

## API Components

### Core API

- **FastAPI Application Setup**: Configured in `nomic/main.py` with CORS middleware, routes inclusion, and startup settings.
- **CORS Middleware**: Allows or restricts resources on a web page from requesting resources from another domain.

### Routes

- **Home Route**: Basic route for server root access.
- **Authentication Routes**: Includes user registration, login, and token validation.
- **Game Management Routes**: Handling game creation, joining, rule submission, and voting via API and WebSocket.

### WebSocket

- Managed in `nomic/routes/ws.py`, it handles real-time communication for game events.
- **WebSocket Route**: `/ws` for accepting connections and broadcasting game updates.

## Database Setup

- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Used for defining database models and performing database operations.
- **Alembic**: Manages schema migrations.
- **Models**: Defined in `nomic/database/models.py`, starting with a `User` model.
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard create, read, update, and delete operations are managed in `nomic/database/crud.py`.

## Security

- **Passlib**: Library for password hashing.
- **JWT**: Used for generating and verifying tokens to handle authentication and authorization.
- **OAuth2**: Security protocol for token management in HTTP services.

## Development and Deployment

- **Poetry**: Manages dependencies and virtual environments.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application for consistent deployment environments.
- **Alembic**: For handling database migrations.

## Testing

- **Pytest**: For writing and running tests.
- **Test Coverage**: Includes API endpoints and WebSocket connections.

## Setup and Installation

Detailed setup and installation instructions are available in `README.md`, covering environment setup, dependency installation, and running the application.

## Future Considerations

- Integrating more sophisticated user and session management.
- Expanding the database schema to support advanced game mechanics.
- Enhancing WebSocket functionality for better real-time interactions.
