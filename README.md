# stf-nomic-game

## Introduction
This project is a Flask-based server setup for the Nomic game application. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide for server setup, local testing procedures, and an overview of the project's structure to facilitate future development and assist developers in understanding and running the project efficiently.

## Flask Server Setup
To set up the Flask server for the Nomic game application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install Flask by running `pip install Flask` in your terminal.
3. To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run `python app.py`.

## Project Structure
The project structure is designed to be simple yet functional, with `app.py` serving as the entry point of the application and `views.py` containing the route definitions. Here's a brief overview:

- `app.py`: Initializes the Flask app and includes the main configuration.
- `views.py`: Defines the Flask routes and the associated logic.

## Local Testing
To test the setup locally, follow these steps:

1. After setting up the Flask server as described above, ensure the server is running.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the application.

This README aims to provide a clear guide for setting up and testing the Flask server for the Nomic game application. For further development, refer to the project's documentation and code comments.
